## Advent of Code 2021

My code for the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/) challenges for 2021.
I decided to revisit Rust for this year's edition (I tried AoC + Rust back in 2019, but didn't finish all challenges that year).

If you have any remarks or improvements for my use of Rust, please do let me know, I want to improve!
